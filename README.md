# ember-cli-fast-table
Speed up table re-rendering by wrapping up array elements into objects to prevent Ember from tearing down and re-creating existing views.

The new Glimmer rendering engine on Ember 1.13 will fix this performance killer, but if you are on Ember 1.12, this addon can be your friend.
