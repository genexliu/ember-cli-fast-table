# ember-cli-fast-table
Speed up table re-rendering by wrapping up array elements into objects to prevent Ember from tearing down and re-creating existing views.

The new Glimmer rendering engine on Ember 1.13 fixes this performance killer. If you are not on 1.13 yet, I strongly recommend you to do so, but if you are somewhat stuck on Ember 1.12, this addon can be your friend.
